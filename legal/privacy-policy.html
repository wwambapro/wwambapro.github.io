                        You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination in the form of legally prohibited increases in the price or decreases in the quality of our Service.

                        How to exercise your California rights.  You may exercise your California privacy rights described above as follows:
                    </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Right to information, access and deletion. You can request to exercise your information, access and deletion rights, by emailing ____@cxtcapital.co.uk.</br>

                                We reserve the right to confirm your California residence to process your requests and will need to confirm your identity to process your requests to exercise your information, access or deletion rights.</br>

                                As part of this process, government identification may be required.  Consistent with California law, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. </br>

                                In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government-issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government issued identification.</br>
                                We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.</br></br>

                                Request a list of third party marketers. California’s “Shine the Light” law (California Civil Code § 1798.83) allows California residents to ask companies with whom they have formed a business relationship primarily for personal, family or household purposes to provide certain information about the companies’ sharing of certain personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding year (if any). </br>

                                You can submit such a request by sending an email to ___@cxtcapital.co.uk with “Shine the Light” in the subject line.  The request must include your current name, street address, city, state, and zip code and attest to the fact that you are a California resident.</br>
